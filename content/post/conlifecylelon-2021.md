I was a last-minute presenter at the [Continuous Lifecycle London 2021](https://2021.continuouslifecycle.london/) conference!

Another speaker cancelled their talk and I was contacted to give a flavor of the Istio talk I gave to Workday's internal tech conference, Spelunking.

My talk, ["Tales of deploying Istio Ingress	"](https://2021.continuouslifecycle.london/sessions/tales-of-deploying-istio-ingress/), is an extended version of the talk given at Workday Spelunking in April 2021.

> This talk presents Workdayâ€™s journey towards deploying Istio Ingress to our Public Cloud environments. As we transferred our services from our legacy ingress to our new Istio ingress solution, a number of platform and application-layer issues surfaced. This talk presents how browser policy, HSTS, cookie stickiness, and headers can break applications, how we debugged those issues, and how we resolved them.
>
> Attendees can expect to learn some common and less common pitfalls of updating platform and infrastructure, the tools and techniques to triage them, and how they can impact the underlying applications.

You will find my slides on [my SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/plallin/tales-of-deploying-istio-ingress).
