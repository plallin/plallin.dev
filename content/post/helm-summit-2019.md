I spoke at the Helm Summit 2019 in Amsterdam!

The [Helm Summit](https://www.cncf.io/events/helm-summit-2019/) is a CNCF Conference focused on [Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes](https://helm.sh/).

My talk, ["Automated Helm deployments using custom controllers and operators"](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/helm-summit-2019/program/schedule/), is a spotlight of the work done by myself and my team at Workday.

> This talk is presenting two ways to recover from an unsuccessful Helm release deployment, showcasing Helm automation and resilience. The talk will present both a custom Kubernetes controller, as well as leveraging a community developed Helm operator.

I was honoured have my talk voted [the most popular talk](https://helmsummit2019.sched.com/popular) of the Helm Summit 2019 :)

You will find the slides on [my SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/plallin/automated-helm-deployments-using-custom-controllers-and-operators)

All talks were filmed and uploaded to Youtube. Alas, a technical issue prevented the recording of most of my talk and only the end of it has been recorded.

Immediately after the talk, I went to Tanzania for another kind of summit :)
