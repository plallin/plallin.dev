I was invited to talk at the [Continuous Lifecycle London 2020](https://2020.continuouslifecycle.london/) conference!

This conference was initially scheduled as an in-person conference in May 2020, but due to the covid-19 pandemic, it was rescheduled as a virtual conference in July 2020.

This talk is an extended version of the talk given at the Helm Summit in September 2019. It features more demonstrations and more explanations around operators (in particular about the Helm Operator from Flux).

You will find my slides on [my SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/plallin/using-helm-to-achieve-frictionless-deployments).

The session description is available [here](https://2020.continuouslifecycle.london/speakers/pauline-lallinec-workday/).

The recording is available [here](https://www.bigmarker.com/situation-publishing/Using-Helm-to-achieve-frictionless-deployments?show_live_page=true) (behind a paywall)

Understandably, 2020 has been a very challenging year for giving talks and attending conferences. I'm glad I could get to give a talk at Continuous Lifecycle London, albeit virtual.
